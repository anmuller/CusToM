HOW TO INSTALL BTK FOR MATLAB UNDER LINUX 64-BIT
------------------------------------------------

The Matlab functions are mainly MEX function which depend
on the following BTK dynamic libraries:
 - libBTKCommon.so
 - libBTKIO.so
 - libBTKBasicFilters.so

Without them on your computer, Matlab will send you messages such as:
"??? Invalid MEX-file '/home/xyz/packages/btk/btkReadAcquisition.mexa64':
libBTKIO.so.0.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory."

So you need to install all the files related to the dynamic libraries into a directory
known by Linux. The easiest is to move the files from the folder <package_btk_path>/lib into
the folder /usr/local/lib (ubuntu) or /usr/lib64 (Fedora). Note that you must copy only the
files and not the folder.
IMPORTANT: You must use the command 'sudo ldconfig' in a terminal afterwards.

Then, the content of the folder <package_btk_path>/Matlab can be copied anywhere on you
computer. The most important when using it for the first time in Matlab is to add its
location in the list of known paths by Matlab (Menu File > Set Path, or use the command
addpath in Matlab). 

HOW TO FIX THE MATLAB ERROR RELATED TO GLIBCXX
----------------------------------------------

If Matlab send you an error about an unknown version of GLIBCXX, it is because Matlab embeds
is own version and conflicts with the version in your computer. The only way found to fix
this is to move the files libstdc++.so.6.* from the folder MATLABXY/sys/os/glnx(86|a64) to
another folder, for example MATLABXY/sys/os/glnx(86|a64)/_btk_fix_glibcxx.

Note: In a more recent version of Maltab (R2012a) the libstdc++.so.6.* files are in the
folder MATLABXY/bin/glnxa64.You still need to move the files to another folder.
