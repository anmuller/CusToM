function hc = btkCloneAcquisition(ho) %#ok
%BTKCLONEACQUISITION Clone the given acquisition.
% 
%  HC = BTKCLONEACQUISITION(HO) creates a deep copy (HC) of the acquisition (HO).
%
%  The original acquisition is represented by the handle HO. 
%  The cloned acquisition is returned as a handle (HC).
%
%  The release of the memory associated with the handle HC can be done automatically
%  by Matlab when you use the command 'clear all', or you can use the function
%  BTKDELETEACQUISITION.  The use of the function BTKDELETEACQUISITION is greatly
%  advised when you are doing batch processing as Matlab does not manage the C++
%  memory and an "Out of memory" error could be thrown.
