function r = btkGetPointsResiduals(h) %#ok
%BTKGETPOINTSRESIDUALS Extract points' residuals and store them in a matrix
% 
%  R = BTKGETPOINTSRESIDUALS(H) returns a matrix of real.  The number of rows
%  of this matrix corresponds to the number of frames in the acquisition.
%  The number of columns of this matrix corresponds to the number of points.
%  The biomechanical acquisition handle H is represented as a double
%  and can be only used with the btk* functions.
