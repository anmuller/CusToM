function btkGetPoint(h, idx_or_label) %#ok
%BTKGETPOINT Get point's data.
% 
%  VALUES = BTKGETPOINT(H, INDEX) returns the point's component as a matrix (N,3) 
%  where N corresponds to the number of frames in the acquisition.
%
%  [VALUES, RESIDUALS] = BTKGETPOINT(H, INDEX) returns the point's residuals in a matrix (N,1) 
%
%  [VALUES, RESIDUALS, INFO] = BTKGETPOINT(H, INDEX) returns some point's information
%  in a structure:
%    - INFO.LABEL
%    - INFO.DESCRIPTION
%    - INFO.FREQUENCY
%    - INFO.UNITS
%  INFO.LABEL and INFO.DESCRIPTION contains the (true) label and description of the
%  extracted point.  INFO.FREQUENCY contains the point's frequency.  INFO.UNITS
%  contains the point's unit.
%
%  You can get the point's data by using its LABEL instead of its index.
%  VALUES = BTKGETPOINT(H, LABEL)
%  [VALUES, RESIDUALS] = BTKGETPOINT(H, LABEL)
%  [VALUES, RESIDUALS, INFO] = BTKGETPOINT(H, LABEL)
%
%  The acquisition is represented by the handle H.  This handle is obtained
%  by the use of a btk* function.
