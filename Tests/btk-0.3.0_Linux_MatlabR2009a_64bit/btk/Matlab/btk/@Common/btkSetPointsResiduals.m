function btkSetPointsResiduals(h. r) %#ok
%BTKSETPOINTSRESIDUALS Sets points' residuals from a matrix
% 
%  BTKSETPOINTSRESIDUALS(H, R) uses the matrix R to sets points' residuals.
%  The number of rows of the matrix corresponds to the number of frames in the acquisition. 
%  The number of columns of this matrix corresponds to the number of points.
%  The biomechanical acquisition handle H is represented as a double and can
%  be only used with the btk* functions.
