function [values info] = btkGetAnalog(h) %#ok
%BTKGETANALOG Extract one analog channel from a biomechanical acquisition
% 
%  VALUES = BTKGETANALOG(H, INDEX) returns a column vector with the values for one 
%  analog channel based on the given INDEX. The biomechanical acquisition handle H is 
%  represented as a double and can be only used with the btk* functions.
%
%  [VALUES INFO] = BTKGETANALOG(H, INDEX) returns the informations associated with the 
%  the selected analog channel. The structure INFO has the followig fields:
%    - INFO.LABEL
%    - INFO.DESCRIPTION
%    - INFO.GAIN
%    - INFO.OFFSET
%    - INFO.SCALE
%    - INFO.FREQUENCY
%    - INFO.UNITS
%  INFO.LABEL and INFO.DESCRIPTION contains the (true) label and description of the
%  extracted analog channel.  INFO.GAIN, INFO.OFFSET and INFO.SCALE contains the
%  required parameters to convert the digital measure into its analog variant.
%  INFO.FREQUENCY contains the analogs' frequency.  INFO.UNITS contains the unit of
%  the analog channel.
%
%  You can get the analog channel's data by using its LABEL instead of its index.
%  VALUES = BTKGETANALOG(H, LABEL)
%  [VALUES, INFO] = BTKGETANALOG(H, LABEL)
