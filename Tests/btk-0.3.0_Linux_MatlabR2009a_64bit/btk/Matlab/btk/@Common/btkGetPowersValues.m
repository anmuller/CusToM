function v = btkGetPowersValues(h) %#ok
%BTKGETPOWERSVALUES Extract powers' components and store them in a matrix
% 
%  V = BTKGETPOWERSVALUES(H) returns a matrix of real.  The number of rows
%  of this matrix corresponds to the number of frames in the acquisition.
%  The number of columns of this matrix corresponds to the number of 
%  extracted powers multiplied by 3 (their components X,Y,Z).
%  The biomechanical acquisition handle H is represented as a double
%  and can be only used with the btk* functions.
