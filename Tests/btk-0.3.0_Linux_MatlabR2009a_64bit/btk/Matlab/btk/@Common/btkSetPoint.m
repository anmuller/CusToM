function btkSetPoint(h, idx_or_label, values, residuals) %#ok
%BTKSETPOINT Modify point's data and return updated points.
% 
%  BTKSETPOINT(H, INDEX, VALUES) modifies point's values by VALUES for the 
%  point at the index INDEX.  VALUES must be a matrix (N,3) where N 
%  corresponds to the number of frames in the acquisition.
%
%  BTKSETPOINT(H, INDEX, VALUES, RESIDUALS) modifies also the point's 
%  residuals. RESIDUALS is matrix (N,1) and corresponds to the residuals of
%  the 3D reconstruction of markers. 
%  NOTE: The residual is an informational parameter and is not available 
%  in every file format.
%
%  BTKSETPOINT(H, INDEX, VALUES, RESIDUALS, DESCRIPTION) modifies also 
%  the description of the point.
%
%  The point to modify can also be selected by its LABEL.
%  BTKSETPOINT(H, LABEL, VALUES)
%  BTKSETPOINT(H, LABEL, VALUES, RESIDUALS)
%  BTKSETPOINT(H, LABEL, VALUES, RESIDUALS, DESCRIPTION)
%
%  This function can also returns an updated list of points.
%  POINTS = BTKSETPOINT(H, INDEX, VALUES)
%  POINTS = BTKSETPOINT(H, INDEX, VALUES, RESIDUALS)
%  POINTS = BTKSETPOINT(H, INDEX, VALUES, RESIDUALS, DESCRIPTION)
%  POINTS = BTKSETPOINT(H, LABEL, VALUES)
%  POINTS = BTKSETPOINT(H, LABEL, VALUES, RESIDUALS)
%  POINTS = BTKSETPOINT(H, LABEL, VALUES, RESIDUALS, DESCRIPTION)
%  The format of POINTS is the same than using the function <a href="matlab:help btkGetPoints">btkGetPoints</a>
%
%  This function can also returns an updated list of points' informations.
%  [POINTS, POINTSINFO] = BTKSETPOINT(H, INDEX, VALUES)
%  [POINTS, POINTSINFO] = BTKSETPOINT(H, INDEX, VALUES, RESIDUALS)
%  [POINTS, POINTSINFO] = BTKSETPOINT(H, INDEX, VALUES, RESIDUALS, DESCRIPTION)
%  [POINTS, POINTSINFO] = BTKSETPOINT(H, LABEL, VALUES)
%  [POINTS, POINTSINFO] = BTKSETPOINT(H, LABEL, VALUES, RESIDUALS)
%  [POINTS, POINTSINFO] = BTKSETPOINT(H, LABEL, VALUES, RESIDUALS, DESCRIPTION)
%  The format of POINTSINFO is the same than using the function <a href="matlab:help btkGetPoints">btkGetPoints</a>
%
%  The acquisition is represented by the handle H.  This handle is obtained
%  by the use of a btk* function.
