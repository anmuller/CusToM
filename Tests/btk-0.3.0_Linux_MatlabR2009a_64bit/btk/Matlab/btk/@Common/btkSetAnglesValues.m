function btkSetAnglesValues(h, v) %#ok
%BTKSETANGLESVALUES Sets angles' components from a matrix
% 
%  BTKSETANGLESVALUES(H, V) uses the matrix V to sets angles' components.
%  The number of rows of the matrix corresponds to the number of frames in the acquisition. 
%  The number of  columns of this matrix corresponds to the number of extracted 
%  angles multiplied by 3 (their components X,Y,Z).
%  The biomechanical acquisition handle H is represented as a double and can be 
%  only used with the btk* functions.
