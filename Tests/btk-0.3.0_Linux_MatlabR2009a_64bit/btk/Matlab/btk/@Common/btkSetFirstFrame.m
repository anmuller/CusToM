function btkSetFirstFrame(h, ff, adaptEvents) %#ok
%BTKSETFIRSTFRAME Set acquisition's first frame index (and optionally adapt events' frame/time).
% 
%  BTKSETFIRSTFRAME(H, FF) replace the first frame index by the content of 
%  FF for a given biomechanical acquistion represented by the handle H.  
%  This handle must be obtained by the use of a btk* function.
%
%  BTKSETFIRSTFRAME(H, FF, ADAPTEVENTS) adapt also event's frame/time if 
%  the option ADAPTEVENTS is set to a non-null value.  The event's frame 
%  is shifted by the difference between the new first frame and the old 
%  one.  The event's time is recomputed using the new frame and the current
%  point's frequency.
