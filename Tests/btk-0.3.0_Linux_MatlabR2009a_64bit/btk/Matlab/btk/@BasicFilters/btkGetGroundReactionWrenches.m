function GRW = btkGetGroundReactionWrenches(h, threshold) %#ok
%BTKGETGROUNDREACTIONWRENCHES Extract ground reaction wrenches (GRW) from a biomechanical acquisition in the global frame.
% 
%  GRW = BTKGETGROUNDREACTIONWRENCHES(H) returns a structure of wrenches 
%  computed from force platform data.
%  The structure GRW is a row structure where each row contains 
%  data for one wrench.  Fieldnames for each row are:
%   - GRW(i).P
%   - GRW(i).F
%   - GRW(i).M
%  The field P is a matrix (n,3) where n is the number of frames and contains the
%  positions of the wrench in the global frame.  The field F is a matrix (n,3) 
%  which contains wrench's forces in the global frame.  The field M is a matrix 
%  (n,3) which contains wrench's moments in the global frame.
%  The biomechanical acquisition handle H is represented as a double  and can be 
%  only used with the btk* functions.
%
%  GRW = BTKGETGROUNDREACTIONWRENCHES(H, THRESHOLD) compute ground reaction wrenches and 
%  set all point of wrench application computed with a Fz value lower or equal than the 
%  given THRESHOLD value (in newton) to the position (0,0,0).
